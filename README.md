# GraphPOPE

GraphPOPE is a preprocessing module that enhances the feature matrix by sampling n amount of anchor nodes and calculating normalized geodesic distances to these nodes for all nodes. These normalized geodesic distance embeddings are then added to the feature matrix and taken into account over convolutions.

This is a personal repository for my Information Studies - Data Science track master thesis titled: "GraphPOPE: Retaining Structural Graph Information Using Position-aware Node Embeddings". The aim of this research is improving accuracy for Graph Convolutional Networks operating on large graphs, specifically by enhancing graph sampling GCN models.
